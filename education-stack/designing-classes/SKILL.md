# Class Session Design Skill

## Triggering Contexts

- User has a course blueprint and needs to design individual sessions
- User is planning a specific class/lesson
- User asks "what should I cover in this session?"
- User struggles with balancing content for different student levels

## Core Principle

> **Every session must answer: "What can students DO after this class that they couldn't before?"**
> If you can't answer this, the session needs redesigning.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Session Context

Before designing, establish:

```markdown
## Session Context
- **Session #:** [N] of [Total]
- **Module:** [Which module this belongs to]
- **Course outcomes served:** [Which outcomes this session advances]
- **Prerequisites:** [What students should know from previous sessions]
- **What comes next:** [What the next session expects them to know]
```

### Step 2: Define Session Outcome

Write ONE primary outcome for this session:

- Observable (can you see them do it?)
- Specific (not "understand X" but "apply X to Y")
- Connected to a course-level outcome

Optional: 1-2 secondary outcomes.

### Step 3: Layered Content Design

Design content in **three layers** to handle mixed audiences:

```markdown
### 🟢 Core Layer (Everyone Must Get This)
- The essential concept/skill
- Simplified explanations
- One clear example
- Time: ~50% of session

### 🟡 Extension Layer (Intermediate Students)
- Deeper nuance, edge cases
- "Why" behind the "what"
- Additional examples with variation
- Time: ~30% of session

### 🔴 Challenge Layer (Advanced Students)
- Real-world complexity
- "What if..." scenarios
- Connection to advanced topics
- Optional homework/exploration
- Time: ~20% of session
```

**Key rule:** Core must stand alone. A beginner who only gets the Core layer should still meet the session outcome.

### Step 4: Format & Activity Design

Choose and sequence activities:

| Format | Best For | Time Guideline |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Lecture** | New concepts, theory, context | 15-20 min blocks max |
| **Demo** | Showing how to do something | 10-15 min |
| **Workshop** | Hands-on practice with guidance | 20-40 min |
| **Discussion** | Processing ideas, different perspectives | 10-20 min |
| **Individual work** | Applying concepts independently | 15-30 min |
| **Group activity** | Collaborative problem-solving | 20-30 min |
| **Assessment** | Checking understanding | 10-20 min |

**Rules:**

- Never lecture for more than 20 minutes without an activity break
- Include at least one hands-on activity per session
- End with a concrete takeaway or action item

### Step 5: Session Flow Template

```markdown
## Session [N]: [Title]
**Duration:** [X minutes/hours]
**Outcome:** [Session outcome]
**Outcomes served:** [Course outcomes]

### Opening (5-10 min)
- Hook: [Attention-grabbing question, story, or demo]
- Connection: [How this relates to previous session]
- Roadmap: [What we'll cover today]

### Block 1: [Topic] (XX min)
- **Format:** [Lecture/Demo/Workshop]
- **Core:** [What everyone learns]
- **Extension:** [Additional depth]
- **Activity:** [What students do]

### Block 2: [Topic] (XX min)
- **Format:** [...]
- **Core:** [...]
- **Extension:** [...]
- **Activity:** [...]

### Application (XX min)
- **Format:** [Workshop/Individual/Group]
- **Task:** [What students practice]
- **Challenge variant:** [Harder version for advanced]

### Closing (5-10 min)
- **Key takeaway:** [One sentence summary]
- **Connection forward:** [Preview of next session]
- **Action item:** [What to do before next class]
```

### Step 6: Persona Check

For each major content block, verify:

| Content Block | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Block 1 | ✅ Core covers it | ✅ Extension adds depth | ✅ Challenge available |
| Block 2 | ⚠️ Might need scaffolding | ✅ Good | ✅ Already knows this |
| Activity | ✅ Simplified version | ✅ Standard | ✅ Extended version |

Flag if any persona is neglected for too long.

## Red Flags to Call Out

- ⚠️ **All lecture, no activity:** Session is passive → Add hands-on
- ⚠️ **No session outcome:** Can't answer "what can they DO?" → Define one
- ⚠️ **Persona neglect:** Content only works for one level → Add layers
- ⚠️ **No connection:** Session doesn't link to previous or next → Fix sequencing
- ⚠️ **Scope creep:** Trying to cover 5 topics → Focus on 1-2 max
- ⚠️ **Missing hook:** Session starts with theory → Add an engaging opening

## Cross-References

- Use `planning-courses` blueprint for session context
- After designing all sessions → Use `aligning-curriculum` for consistency check
