# Education Stack

A structured workflow for designing courses that stay aligned with learning outcomes, serve mixed-level audiences, and maintain consistency across sessions.

## Skills Overview

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **planning-courses** | Top-down course architecture | Starting a new course or restructuring |
| **designing-classes** | Individual session design | Designing each class |
| **aligning-curriculum** | Consistency & alignment check | After designing sessions |

## Recommended Workflow

```
1. Planning → Define outcomes, personas, modules
      ↓
2. Designing → Build each session with layered content
      ↓
3. Aligning → Check everything connects
      ↓
   (iterate until consistent)
```

## Key Concepts

### Outcomes First

Start with what students can **DO**, not what topics to **cover**.

### Layered Content

Every session has three layers for mixed audiences:

- 🟢 **Core** — Everyone must get this (50%)
- 🟡 **Extension** — Deeper nuance (30%)
- 🔴 **Challenge** — Advanced exploration (20%)

### Student Personas

Define 2-3 representative student profiles and check every design decision against them.

### 7-Point Alignment Check

1. Outcome coverage matrix
2. Prerequisite chain
3. Difficulty progression
4. Format distribution
5. Persona balance
6. Assessment coverage
7. Coherence test
