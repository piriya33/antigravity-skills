# Curriculum Alignment Check

## Triggering Contexts

- User has completed (or partially completed) session designs
- User feels the course is "drifting" or inconsistent
- User wants to verify course quality before teaching
- User asks "does this course make sense as a whole?"

## Core Principle

> **Alignment = Every piece connects to the whole.**
> If a topic doesn't serve an outcome, cut it.
> If an outcome has no assessment, add one.
> If a session has no purpose, redesign it.

## Alignment Checks

### Check 1: Outcome Coverage Matrix

Map every session to the outcomes it serves:

| Session | Out. 1 | Out. 2 | Out. 3 | Out. 4 | Out. 5 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| S1 | I | | | | |
| S2 | P | I | | | |
| S3 | P | P | I | | |
| S4 | | P | P | I | |
| S5 | A | | P | P | I |
| S6 | | A | A | P | P |
| S7 | | | | A | A |

**Legend:** I = Introduce, P = Practice, A = Assess

**Red flags:**

- ❌ Outcome column is empty → Outcome never taught
- ❌ Outcome has I but no P → Introduced but never practiced
- ❌ Outcome has no A → Never assessed
- ❌ Session row is empty → Session serves no outcome (cut it)
- ⚠️ A appears before P → Assessing before students practiced

### Check 2: Prerequisite Chain

Verify no session requires knowledge not yet taught:

```
Session 3 requires: [concept from S1] ✅, [concept from S2] ✅
Session 5 requires: [concept from S3] ✅, [concept from S7] ❌ NOT YET TAUGHT
```

**Fix:** Resequence sessions or move prerequisites earlier.

### Check 3: Difficulty Progression

Plot the difficulty curve:

```
Difficulty
  ▲
  │          ╱──╲
  │      ╱──╱    ╲──╲
  │  ╱──╱              ╲
  │╱                     
  └──────────────────────→ Sessions
  S1  S2  S3  S4  S5  S6
```

**Red flags:**

- ❌ Flat line → No progression, students get bored
- ❌ Spike → Session is too hard relative to neighbors
- ❌ Drop after spike → Inconsistent difficulty
- ✅ Gradual incline with occasional plateaus → Healthy

### Check 4: Format Distribution

Count format types across all sessions:

| Format | Count | % of Total | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|
| Lecture | 12 | 40% | ⚠️ Too high if > 40% |
| Workshop | 8 | 27% | ✅ Good |
| Discussion | 4 | 13% | ✅ OK |
| Project | 3 | 10% | ✅ Good |
| Assessment | 3 | 10% | ✅ Good |

**Red flags:**

- ⚠️ Lecture > 40% → Course is too passive
- ⚠️ Workshop < 20% → Not enough practice
- ⚠️ Assessment < 5% → Not enough feedback loops

### Check 5: Persona Balance

For each persona, check their experience across the course:

```markdown
### Beginner Persona: [Name]
- Sessions where they might struggle: [list]
- Sessions where they'll feel confident: [list]
- Overall: ✅ Balanced / ⚠️ Too hard / ⚠️ Too easy

### Advanced Persona: [Name]
- Sessions where they might be bored: [list]
- Sessions where they'll be challenged: [list]
- Overall: ✅ Balanced / ⚠️ Under-challenged / ⚠️ Frustrated
```

### Check 6: Assessment Coverage

| Outcome | Assessment Type | Session | Format |
|---------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Outcome 1 | Project | S5 | Individual |
| Outcome 2 | Quiz | S4 | Written |
| Outcome 3 | Presentation | S6 | Group |
| Outcome 4 | ❌ MISSING | — | — |

**Every outcome must be assessed.** No exceptions.

### Check 7: Coherence Test

Answer these questions:

1. Can you explain the course in one sentence?
2. Does every session advance that sentence?
3. If you removed any session, would students miss a critical step?
4. Does the final session/assessment prove the one-sentence promise?

If any answer is "no," the curriculum needs adjustment.

## Overall Score: [X/7 checks passed]

### ✅ Passed Checks
- [List]

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. [Issue]: [Description] → [Recommended fix]
2. [Issue]: [Description] → [Recommended fix]

### Action Items

## When to Run This Check

- ✅ After completing all session designs (full review)
- ✅ After modifying any session (targeted review)
- ✅ Before teaching the course (final validation)
- ✅ After teaching, using student feedback (iterative improvement)
