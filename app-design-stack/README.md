# App Design Stack

This stack provides a comprehensive, end-to-end workflow for designing and building modern web and mobile applications. It combines deep UX research, high-end visual design systems, and robust full-stack scaffolding into a suite of specialized skills.

## The Skills

This stack is composed of three core, specialized skills that are designed to work together or be used independently:

### 1. `ui-ux-designer` (The Architect & Researcher)
**Focus:** User research, wireframing, accessibility, and component planning.
**Use when:** You need to map out user flows, plan a design system's architecture, ensure WCAG compliance, or structure complex layouts before visual styling begins.

### 2. `ui-ux-pro-max` (The Visual Designer)
**Focus:** High-end aesthetic rules, typography scaling, color theory, and CSS implementation.
**Use when:** You need production-grade styling. This skill includes a powerful Python-based BM25 search engine (`search.py`) that queries massive CSV databases of design rules, ensuring your outputs avoid "generic AI UI" and instead utilize intentional, calculated design systems.

### 3. `app-builder` (The Developer)
**Focus:** Tech stack detection, Next.js/React scaffolding, and full-stack implementation.
**Use when:** The design and planning phases are complete, and you need to generate production-ready code, set up directories, and build out the actual application logic and UI components.

## Recommended Workflow

For a new project, we recommend following this sequence:

1. **Plan & Map:** Start with `ui-ux-designer` to define the user requirements, accessible structure, and core components.
2. **Style & Define:** Pass the wireframe requirements to `ui-ux-pro-max` to generate a dedicated, high-impact Design System using the Python BM25 search tools.
3. **Build & Execute:** Provide the generated Design System and component blueprints to `app-builder` to write the actual code.

*Note: These skills were copied directly from an external reference library to maintain their original Python tooling and database connections.*
